## 1.5.1
- *BUGFIX* 
	- Fix random fatal error on plugin activation because some versions of WordPress pass an object instead of an integer value, as the results of a query.  
	- Added explicit checks for `is_object` and `is_int` to avoid Fatal Error

- Changed name from "Gatekeeper" to "CF Gatekeeper"
- Adding a check for the function that's run on plugin activation, it was throwing fatal errors (only on activation) b/c the object wasn't defined yet.
- Change plugin so that it's not enabled by default.  You must go to the settings page, and click to enable it.
	- Add appropriate checks for plugin being enabled/disabled.
	- Add `do_action` functions on plugin enabling/disabling so that we can hook on those actions.
	- Add a message action, so that sites can add custom instructions upon disable/enable.
