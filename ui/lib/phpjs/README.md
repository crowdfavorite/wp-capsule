php.js is an open source project that brings high-level PHP
functions to low-level JavaScript platforms such as webbrowsers,
  AIR, V8 and rhino.

If you want to perform high-level operations on these platforms,
you probably need to write JS that combines it's lower-level
functions and build it up until you have something useful like:
md5(), strip_tags(), strtotime(), number_format(), wordwrap().

That's what we are doing for you.
